            I am a <span className="font-bold text-red-500">Physics major with minors in CS and Math</span> at Drexel University, graduating
            in 2025, also one of the two recipients of <span className="font-bold text-red-500">Larson Endowed Scholarship</span> (awarded based
            on exceptional academic excellence and experimental science research contribution).
            Moreover, I am also one of the recipients of <span className="font-bold text-red-500">Deanâ€™s List</span> (recognizes prolonged maintained
            academic excellence).

            I started my programming journey in the summer of the freshmen year, self-learning from online forums and videos.
            I invested my time on computing topics like data structures, data science, web development. To further my knowledge
            in this field, I accepted <span className="font-bold text-red-500">Teaching Assistant</span> position in the computer science department
            of the university where I helped hundreds of students to grasp the basic concepts of programming and much more.

          <p className="sm:text-center md:text-left mb-5 py-2  text-gray-600">
            My most recent experience come with my <span className="font-bold text-red-500">full time, 6-month, internship at Genesis Global Trading as
            a Blockchain Research Engineer</span>. As someone who adores doing research, this job gave me opportunity
            to combine my CS skills with my passion in research. In my 6 month period, I, along with my team,
            built a software to facilitate transaction on various cryptocurrencies, which not only made me adept in the field
            of blockchain but helped me foster my programming architecture skills to a whole new level.
